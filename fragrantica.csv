The aldehyde note is now surrounded by pelargonium and rose absolute, which somewhat softens the sharp metal note of the original composition, ending with a comfortable combination of oak moss, vetiver, musk and balsamic notes. 
And yet those changes leave the fragrance very recognizable - all the way to the arty flacon. It is a great addition to any perfume lover\'s collection due to its true versatility and impeccable, \'very French\' taste.",,"Aldehydes,Green Notes,Honeysuckle,Bergamot,Peach,Lemon","Rose,iris,Geranium,Ylang-Ylang,Lily-of-the-Valley,Jasmine,Magnolia,Gardenia",3.90,5,"3,417"

","Jicky was created in 1889. It is a classical fragrance and, despite the age, it is timeless and still very modern. According to the legend, the perfume was named after a girl Aime Guerlain was in love with when he was a student in England. It is more likely, though, that this perfume is named after his uncle Jacques Guerlain’s nickname – Jicky. This was one of the first perfumes created with addition of synthetic materials (the first was Fougere Royale Houbigant, 1882). The top notes contain lavender and citrus (bergamot, lemon and mandarin), which perfectly match the cold, metallic orris and rose shaded by vetiver. The cold top and middle notes are an elegant counterbalance to the warm base created of patchouli, vanilla, amber and musk. As Guerlain has always paid a lot of attention to design of flacons, this bottle is also attractive and original: it is designed in a shape of 19th century medicine bottle with champagne cork shaped stopper.

Diorissimo is fresh and clear, just like a dewy, spring morning in the woods. Top notes include lily-of-the- valley and ylang-ylang, the heart is composed of amaryllis and boronia, leaving a jasmine trail.
Christian Dior believed that lily-of-the valley is the symbol of hope, happiness and joy. French consider lily of the valley as the legendary flower. According to the legend a brave and fearless fighter, called Saint Leonard wanted, to spend his days among the flowers and trees and live a life dedicated to God. He asked permission to go live in the woods. A dragon called Temptetaion lived in those woods. They fought and blood was spilled. Leonard bravely fought the dragon until it was defeated. Poisonous weeds began to grow where the dragon spilled his blood, but beds of lilies of the valley started to grom wherever the ground was moistened with Saint Leonard's. The French believe that lily-of-the valley is a holy flower and so did Christian Dior whichinspired the creation of this wonderful fragrance.
The creator from Grasse, France, Edmond Roudnitska, wanted to create a perfume that would be revolutionary and break the trend of sweet perfumes that were dominating the market. The goal was to simplifie perfume’s formula and create a perfume that’s simple and luminous. He dreamed of perfume similar to that of muguet that enveloped his senses when he was resting in his garden. Dior and Roudnitska met in 1955 and made their dream come true in 1956- Diorissimo was created!The perfume was represented by an illustration by René Gruau.According to Christian Dior, Diorissimo is the perfume of his spirit, or, ""the scented expression of his soul"".",Edmond Roudnitska,"Green Leaves,Bergamot","Lily-of-the-Valley,Lilac,Jasmine,Lily,Ylang-Ylang,Amaryllis,Rosemary,Boronia",4.13,5,"3,923"

The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle. 
At first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods – patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer.

","Miyako is a Japanese female name, and the fragrance Myako is very Japanese. This fragrance was inspired by traditional Japanese ritual Kodo, or \'way of the fragrance\'. Kodo is one of the three classical Japanese arts, which besides kodo include the art of creation of Ikebana, and the tea ceremony, Sado. Kodo is a tradition of paying respect to incense. Incense is placed on a plate placed over the smoldering coals. The incense does not burn but slowly releases its fragrance. 
The meaning of kodo is not in smelling, but in \'listening\' to the fragrance. For the kodo ceremony Japanese use the verb kiku, \'listen\', meaning to try to get to know the fragrance with the heart and soul and travel with it through the time and space. 
The tradition of kodo dates back in the time of the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1443-1490), who ordered a monk, Sanjonishi Sanetaka to list and classify all kinds of incense that were used in that time. Thus Sanjonishi is considered to be the father of kodo. 
The scents of incense used in the kodo ceremony are divided in six types with five tastes – sweet, spicy hot, bitter, salty and sour. These qualities are the base for the traditional Japanese game, kumiko or genjiko, the meaning of which is in proper classification of incenses according to these categories, what requires excellent olfactive abilities.
In the heart of Miyako is frankincense, and floral, balsamic and woodsy notes make it a good company. The outer box opens like the door of a Japanese temple. This limited fragrance was launched in 2005.

Chanel N°5 (Vintage)  was launched in 1921. The nose behind this fragrance is Ernest Beaux. Top notes are Aldehydes, Ylang-Ylang, Neroli, Lemon and Bergamot; middle notes are Rose, iris, Jasmine, Orris Root and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Civet, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk, Vanilla, Oakmoss, Patchouli and Vetiver. ","The famous Chanel N°5 is a symbol of good taste and is currently one of the best selling perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel asked the perfume designer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume “which smells like a woman“. Chanel N°5 is a very complex fragrance which does not allow any of the fragrant components to be isolated out of the composition, what was exactly a request of the great Chanel – the perfume should not smell like a rose, or a lily of the valley, but as a composition. 
 The perfume became famous thanks to many celebrities who wore it, among which Marilyn Monroe. Chanel N°5 is often connected to her name because during an interview in 1954 she said that in bed she wore only ‘some drops of Chanel N°5\'. That statement became a superb advertising slogan and a reason for millions of women around the world to choose this perfume. 
 Ernest Beaux created two series of perfume samples numbered 1-5 and 20-24 and asked Coco Chanel to choose one of them. Madame Chanel chose the sample no. 5 and thus the perfume got its name. Superstitious, Chanel presented her new perfume on the fifth day of the fifth month of 1921. 
 Working on creation of this perfume, Ernest Beaux created and for the first time used the synthetic component – aldehydes. In his formula the aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, reminds of the odor of clean linen just brought in the house form the fresh frosty air. It is said that the famous creator drew his inspiration for creation of this fragrance from one of his visits to the Arctic Circle and the smell of water in midnight. The unique smell of frozen lakes and rivers fascinated him so much that he decided to replicate it in his creation. 
 Chanel N°5 is the first perfume in the floral-aldehyde group and the first by the quantity of aldehydes in its composition (another legend says that the Ernest Beaux\'s assistant overdosed the aldehydes in the composition by mistake). The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, lemon, neroli and ylang-ylang, the heart of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and iris, while the base is created of vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, amber and patchouli. 
 The first Chanel N°5 was captured in a simple rectangular bottle with the top which resembled Place Vendome in Paris. The first bottle was designed by Chanel herself and represents her classical principle – less is more.

Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way.

 Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention. The muse for this perfume was Frederic Malle’s aunt, famous actress Candice Bergen, who acted in the movie Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson.

Countess Isabelle d’Ornano was given Eau de Soir as a gift by her husband, count Hubert d'Ornano in 1990. The count created a unique floral composition in the centre of which was Spanish flower seringa. Its fragrance, as in the case of many other types of white flowers, radiates an intense scent through night air and attracts night butterflies to pollinate it. The perfume was created to remind countess of her childhood in Spain. The name was chosen because of night flower seringe (in French, soir means evening). For several years Eau de Soir was countess' personal perfume and it was no sooner than 1999, after her friend persuaded her, that it was released for public.","Hubert d'Ornano,Isabelle d'Ornano,Jeannine Mongin","Grapefruit,Mandarin Orange","oak moss,Juniper,Patchouli,Pepper,iris,Carnation,Rose,Syringa,French labdanum,Jasmine,Lily-of-the-Valley,Ylang-Ylang",4.11,5,"4,135"

","In the creator\'s imagination, Cabotine is a daughter of Cabochard, a younger generation perfume, which has preserved the elegance and distinction of Cabochard. It was created with love and enthusiasm, with a very limited budget, and it became a classic of the 1990-ties. 
It was created by Jean-Claude Delville from IFF, and he was expected to make a light but lasting perfume, what was a hard task to do. The perfumer found its formula in floral-aldehyde accord and presented a transparent fragrance with green floral and sharp aldehyde notes. The perfume is very light, easy to wear and at the same time tenacious. It achieved success regardless of very limited advertising and promotional support. 
The composition is created around the ginger lily, also known as a butterfly lily, a Himalayan large-petalled white flower. Growing in harsh high mountains climate, this plant blooms for only a few weeks in the spring time, and each flower lives only for a few hours, what makes it difficult, almost impossible, to extract the oil. An IFF pioneering researcher, Dr. Braja Mookherjee, found a way to analyse the oil structure using the \'living-flower\' technique, and to copy the fragrance of the ginger lily, what enabled the industrial production. Cabotine is the first perfume which contains ginger lily in its composition.

","Cabochard is a fragrant image of Alix Gres. Even the name, chosen by Madame Gres herself (in French Cabochard means \'stubborn\' or \'headstrong\') reflects her free spirit and will. Cabochard was created after Madame Gres\' trip to India. She described a beautiful perfume to the young perfume creator Guy Robert – very flowery, rich like tuberose yet softer, contrasted by fresh, slightly green note. It was a water hyacinth! After several trials, Madame Gres recognized her perfume. It was light and floral. However, the trend dictated intensive and strong chypre (Tabac Blond (1919), Cuir de Russie (1924), Scandal (1933), Bandit (1944)), so Madame Gres decided to launch two perfumes at the same time: floral Chouda and leather chypre Cabochard, created by Bernard Chant with IFF. 
 Cabochard was launched in 1959 and instantly became very popular; Madame Gres said that it reminded her of her walks along the long and empty beaches of India: sharp freshness of the morning air, warmth of sandalwood, a touch of flower and comfort of the sea breeze. 
 A couple of months after it was created the production of Chouda was suspended. The delivered 5 liters of the perfume was most probably worn by Madame Gres herself. 
 The first bottle of Cabochard was very plain and simple (Madame Gres wanted to minimize the costs), with pharmaceutical top and a grey bow. The Chouda bottle had a green bow.

 This perfume has captured the African temperament and presents a new, fragrant experience. The green sharpness of ripe mango and the spicy warmth of pink pepper make an impressive prelude to the mysterious heart of aromatic frankincense and papyrus smoke. The pure and light smoke wraps the exotic African flower Karo Karounde and mixes with the earthy and green vetiver. The base is composed of balsam, spices, patchouli, myrrh, and vetiver. 
 This wild, magical, and mysterious African fragrance with woodsy notes, thick resins and spices, lasts on skin for a long time. It is created to awake memories and the desire for long-distance travels, as well as to remind one of the beauty and the miracle of life as seen through the eyes of the women of Timbuktu.

","Winter brought us the new fragrance from Bond No. 9, carrying the name of the famous Andy Warhol. The full name of this perfume is Andy Warhol Silver Factory. Andy Warhol is an American artist, born in Pennsylvania in 1928, who became the central figure of the American artistic movement Pop Art. He proved to be an exquisite commercial illustrator, painter, creator of avangard movies, records producer – all in all, very important person in the American art society circles. He did Coca Cola graphics, portraits of many celebrities – Marylyn Monroe and Elisabeth Taylor amongst them. He designed shoes, made movies, did sculptures. Controversial and always in the centre of social happenings, Warhol opens The Factory in 1963, his new York original studio in East 24th Street, its walls covered in tin silver foil, tinsel and silver paint. Warhol himself often decorated interior with silver balloons. Silver, broken mirror pieces and foil marked the 60s. Those few years that the studio was opened are known as the Silver Era, not so much due to the design, more for decadent behavior, prodigality, drugs and parties (the spirit of the 60s). All the celebrity actors, musicians, movie artists, debutant, all of those attached to art, movie industry and music, worked with Warhol: Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan etc. The famous song by Lou Reed, Walk On The Wild Side, was inspired by a superstar that is addicted to Warhol’s Silver Factory. The Factory was opened till 1968, when the studio transferred on the 6th floor of a building on 33 Union Square West. The Silver Factory fragrance, designed by Aurelien Guichard, is soft, smoky scent, wrapped in veil of incense, woody notes and amber. Flowers flourish at the heart: jasmine, iris and violet, the favorite flower of Andy Warhol, bringing, along with iris, metal accord to the composition. Base notes include: bergamot, mildly bitter grapefruit, lavender, violet, amber, jasmine, iris, a mix of wood resins, sweet vanilla and sensual cedar wood. The bottle graphics were inspired by the work of this famous pop art artist. In 1956, he designed package for Campbell’s Soup Can and charged the graphics 1500$, each signed can sold at the price of 6$. This fragrance was introduced as unisex. Warhol once said: „Another way to take up more space is with perfume. I really love wearing perfume” (he also asked to be buried with a bottle of the perfume Beautiful).",Aurelien Guichard,"Lavender,Grapefruit,Bergamot","Incense,iris,Violet,Jasmine",4.24,5,416

The nose behind this fragrance is Bertrand Duchaufour. Top notes are Bergamot, Black Currant and Incense; middle notes are Clay, Magnolia and Tuberose; base notes are Clover, Musk, Patchouli and Amber. ","Eau D\'Italie is not only a visiting card of the world known hotel, but also of the town of Positano and the whole carefree Italian south. All that are looking for an Italian fragrance, modern and antique, as all that is modern in Italy inevitably bears a mark of the history, or for the Mediterranean herbs and recreation in its odorous forests, have to get to know Eau D\'Italie. 
Eau D\'Italie has captured the richness of the Southern Italy coast and the fine charm of Le Sirenuse. Salty sea breeze brings the aroma of orange in bloom, magnolia, unavoidable bergamot and black currant. Italian fragrance has to be sensual, and for that, spices, musk and incense are added to the composition. 
Eau D\'Italie is an unusual fragrance the composition of which is built around mineral and soily accords. The accord of soil or the mineral accord of clay (argile in French) is the central note of the composition. Witty perfumers have created this note of tuberose, or more precise, of its mineral part, by leaving the floral component aside. Thus Eau D\'Italie is an original fragrance of a strong character, for both women and men. 
The unusual opening of this composition is built of the notes of frankincense, accompanied with bergamot and balmy black currant buds. The dominant clay in the heart is surrounded by the floral notes of magnolia and tuberose. The uniqueness of this fragrance is accentuated by its base notes: amber, Island moss, cedar, patchouli, honey, sweet yellow carnation and musk. 
Apart from eau de toilette, Eau D\'Italie is produced as eau de cologne, and with matching body care products – body lotion, shower gel, shampoo, hear conditioner, bath salt, and soap. Therefore, Eau D’Italie can be sprayed, applied, and foamed to relax and soften us, and make us feel just like we are on vacation.

Sensu is versatile and unusual just like its predecessor, created on contrasts of fresh and warm: fresh notes of citrus, green leaves, and the sea, interlace with floral and woodsy accords. The fragrance is very dramatic and picturesque and red, at the same time green and watery fresh, just like a fan wave in an evening that falls over the sea. 
The top unites bergamot, mandarin, sea and green notes. The heart wafts in floral harmony: rose, jasmine, lily of the valley, freesia, pelargonium, iris, peach and tea. The base is composed of vanilla, musk, and moss.

","Aqua di Parma, experienced in production of chic fragrances very popular in high society, has denoted its renaissance with, among other things, eau de toilette Iris Nobile. The new EDT has perfectly fit into the company of renowned fragrances such as Aqua di Parma Colonia (1916) and Profumo (1930), with relaunch of which Aqua di Parma has entered the new millennium and turned over a new sheet in its history. 
 Iris Nobile was created in 2004 by reputable master perfumers – Francoise Caron and Francis Kurkdjian. It was first created as eau de toilette. Classically elegant and feminine delicate floral fragrance is opposing the briskly-aromatic Italian style of the house; however, its moderate rhythm reveals the ambitions of beautiful floral fragrances of the past century. 
 Iris Nobile opens with luminous fresh citrusy notes of orange, mandarin and bergamot, followed by anise. The beauty of the iris flower is accentuated by the whole floral chorus of orange blossom, ylang-ylang, tuberose, mimosa and woodsy cedar nuance in the heart, among which the orange blossom is the most persistent companion. The floral bouquet only accompanies, and not at all overlays the beautiful iris solo – delicate-retro-romantic, with a trace of aery powder. 
 Eau de Parfum Iris Nobile was created in 2006. Besides the general resemblance, the fragrance has become deeper and more intensive, a bit darker and slightly sweeter. The citruses, so dominant in the original, have now been given a marginal role – the focus is on iris, and it has become more accentuated. Besides amber and vanilla, the base now includes oakmoss and patchouli that bring in a dramatic chypre note. EDT was launched as a summer fragrance, while EDP makes a great match to fur.

Pi Neo  was launched in 2008. The nose behind this fragrance is Francoise Donche. Top notes are Mandarin Orange and Bergamot; middle notes are Cedar and Myrtle; base note is Patchouli. ,"Matrix has you. Inspired by The Martix movie, and by the virtual world of the future (or already present) times, Givenchy introduced their perfume Pi Neo in September 2008. It was designed by perfumers of the house of Givaudan. According to the designer, the new perfume is not a variation of the Pi theme, but an absolutely independent fragrance carrying an idea of reality revision. 
 The known fragrancy notes are: mandarin, bergamot, myrrh, cedar and patchouli. 
 Pi is a mathematic constant often used in mathematics and physics. An irrational number. π can be defined in Euclid's pyramid as a relation between volume and diameter of a circle. π is also known as Archimedes' constant and Ludolf's number. The name Pi denotes perimetros, which means 'to measure around' when translated from Greek. 
 Givenchy combined Pi with futuristic Neo from Matrix and reached Givenchy\'s constant: 'to smell well everywhere'! 
 Pi Neo arrives in a glass bottle and by its design it reminds of the original Pi, with a difference that it is not shaped like a pyramid, but like a square, with sharp cut sides and the same top as its predecessor, but this time made of metal and coloured in silver. 
 As for the composition, the olfactive director Francoise Dounche was in charge of this new futuristic composition. He designed this neo-explosive fragrance and combined natural ingredients for the first time: bergamot, mandarin, cedar, patchouli and vanilla with synthesis of three molecules (Toscanol, Safraleine and Cosmone), which makes a completely different base of the fragrance and contributes to a sensational composition. The result is quite special and can be compared with a new dimension created between time and space. 
 Toscanol was created by the house of Givaudan and invented to replace chavicol, and its intention is to contribute to intensity and longevity of the composition. It is stable in aromatic compositions where it prolongs strength and durability of aromas. It is very durable, stays as many as two days on the blotter, when you try the fragrance, and it s very useful for modification of lavender aromas and refreshing spicy aromas. 
 Safraleine is a product by the house of Givaudan, which contributes to unique, hot and twinkling effect and offers a new alternative for spicy combinations. 
 Safraleine offers hot, powerful, tobacco and leather faces, but its complexity reveals spicy characteristics of natural saffron, enriched with floral rose aspects. 
 Cosmone introduces rich and intensive musk accords, which decorate the whole composition with elegant aromas. This biologically decomposive molecule increases volume of environment-friendly chemical components, and it was invented in the house of Givaudan. 
 The perfume Pi Neo is available from September 2008, with an accompanying line of body care products. The perfume is advertised by Kelly Rippy, and the photographer is Solve Sundsbo.

In line with that Gabbana said:""I like spicy-oriental notes and we\'ve never done these types of fragrances, it\'s a little warmer than our other men's scents"". 
 Fragrance The One for Men opens with sparkling notes of bergamot, coriander and basil, the middle motes bring in cardamom, ginger and neroli, while the base notes create a very masculine trace of cedar, ambergris and tobacco. 
 The fragrance is created in cooperation with P&G Prestige Product and International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF). It comes in a glass made bottle that matches the shape of The One for Women bottle, only with silver-metal neck and chocolate-brown rectangular top. 
 The model of the fragrance advertising campaign will be the actor Matthew McConaughey, who will next week join the designers in the NYC. When it comes to the choice of the model, the Dolce&Gabbana designers said that they wanted to have the sexiest man on the planet. And with regards to that, Gabbana adds that this is the first time that a model in one of D&G men\'s fragrance campaigns appears in clothes. 
 The One for Men will be available in the US as EDT in two sizes – 50ml and 100ml bottles.

A rose that tastes of fresh milk, a talcum powdered baby’s bottom, a wealth of sugared kisses. At Etat Libre d’Orange, the Virgin rarely wanders far from the Whore. Perhaps she is one and the same. Warmed by the fire of this woman, the noses have embraced a fanciful vision. They have created for her a perfume of protection, a refuge on the battlefield of love. Defensive yet transparent, Rossy conceals as it reveals. For her, a caress is demanded, while those around her are struck with awe.

And who will jealously sweep her off her feet and into his room, like a child would with his most precious present.
